At MAUGLI, you don’t just get post-production. You get content that breathes, hooks your audience, gets indexed by Google and GPT, is shared where it matters, and keeps living on.

Welcome to post-production, where content isn’t the finish line—
it’s the gateway to a meaning-driven distribution ecosystem.

## SEO? Not just SEO. GPT-SEO

Classic SEO? Sure. Keywords, density, structure, h1–h6, alt tags—we’ve mastered all that. We use precision tools: each step is targeted, clean, and fast.

> **We have GPT-SEO—and it’s a game-changer.**
>
- We don’t just insert keywords.
- We reimagine your post for the intent people are actually searching for.
- We craft summaries using a methodology that lets neural networks—including ChatGPT—see, understand, and reference your content. In other words, they recommend you.

> Yes, our articles are read by more than just people.

And if you didn’t know—GPT is already indexing.

We know how to get your content into GPT’s mind. That is, onto its servers.

## Author Section? That’s SEO, too

Every article can have:

- a semantic summary that works for both Google and neural networks;
- an author signature, whether it’s a person or an editor;
- an extended description that helps you get discovered by meaning, not just keywords.

## Next—Distribution

Each post is adapted into the right formats:

- For Slack posts or newsletters—with a hook and internal link;
- For Facebook Pages—with format-friendly headlines and clean preview images;
- For Medium, Substack, or other public platforms—posted via webhook or RSS with proper styling;
- And yes, RSS/XML are built in to trigger full external reposting.
- Reposts to LinkedIn, Bluesky, and others increase your presence across ecosystems.
