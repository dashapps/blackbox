Blackbox is not documentation.  
It’s a story about how MAUGLI works and how it’s built.  
No code. No fluff. No marketing noise. Just the essence.

MAUGLI is not a standard product. And it’s not for everyone.

Blackbox is written to make that clear from the start.  
If our approach doesn’t suit you — close the tab.  
If it does — you’ll get it as you read.

> MAUGLI is for those who are ready to work the day after tomorrow.

If you’re not afraid of unconventional solutions — even if they’re “not typical yet.”

If you see new ways to optimize.

If you want content to solve business tasks without your constant involvement — open it:
