One of the main reasons why Maugli isn’t just another content generator: insight research.

Content that truly works doesn’t start with a prompt. It starts with understanding:

- what your audience wants to hear;
- what they’re already talking about;
- what they can’t Google, but are dying to understand.

This is where our dual insight resource kicks in.

## Two research cores — depending on strategy

### 1. SEO engine

We use this for products that:

- are already being searched for;
- have well-formed questions around them;
- require organic search through keywords.

Here, we build content around pain points you can type into Google or ask GPT.

This is classic SEO — but with living, breathing formats, not boring “10 reasons to use a CRM” articles.

What works here:

→ semantic analysis
→ clustering
→ answer generation powered by GPT and Claude vectors
→ human curation of final formats (post, longread, reply, microformat)

### 2. Insight resource

When we don’t wait for people to form a question — we go where the conversation is already on fire. Reddit, forums, ProductHunt, HackerNews — wherever your audience is.

The key: real people, real pain.

That’s where the magic starts.

## How we surface insights and pain points

Once set up, the process takes just a few minutes. But it’s multi-step:

1. scan dozens of subreddits and channels;
2. score them with internal models: real value, engagement potential, audience match;
3. run them through AI lenses — logic, emotion, structure;
4. select the juiciest insights, worthy of analysis or an emotional trigger.

How is this different from “just checking out the competition”?

- Speed — from system launch to dozens of ideas in minutes.
- Quality — the kind editorial teams keep a dedicated analyst for.
- Format — from memes and hot takes to evergreen longreads.

## Evergreen or viral?

We do both:

- Evergreen — goes to your blog, landing pages, index.
- Insight drops — go to socials, reposts, discussions, emotional hooks.

Want more replies? We focus on hot takes.
Want Google index and clear structure? We focus on articles.

Yes, you can have both. Depending on your strategy and goals.

## And this is just the first filter

Editorial is the next stage.

Every insight gets squeezed, edited, wrapped in the right format, and tested.

But that’s for later.

Right now, the key is:

You won’t be searching for ideas.
You won’t even be approving or filtering them until they’re already a content unit. We’ll serve you the best the internet has to offer — already tailored to your audience’s favorite recipe. On a platter, with a side of meaning.
