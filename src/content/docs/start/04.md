So, you’ve realized you’ve found the answer—and you’re ready to join us.

We’re not your typical SaaS where you just click “Sign Up” and try to squeeze out some “magic” on your own.

We are a system, custom-built for your reality. Think of it as a bespoke operating system for your content.

## Step One — You Bring Your Product

You tell us about it—either live or through our GPT-powered interviewer.

The second option is often more convenient: interact anytime, let the AI dig deep, capture every detail, and structure it all. When you’re done, just send us the chat link.

## Step Two — Upfront Commitment: 50% of the First Month

We build your virtual in-house editorial team.

**In the physical world:** office space, hiring, overhead.

With us, it’s **full configuration and launch for you:** prompts as job descriptions, team assembly, blog and account setup as your digital workspace.

This isn’t a “let me try it for free” kind of deal.

## Step Three — Precision Engineering

1. You provide your source materials—brand assets, product docs, anything useful.
2. We run analytics and strategy: goals, channels, audience segments, Tone of Voice, topics.
3. We give you a strategic map. Not just one. Pricing templates are just a reference—modular setup gives you real flexibility.
4. Final call is yours.

## Step Four — Configuration

We implement the strategy:

- Build personas (audience avatars),
- Identify their pain points and triggers,
- Parse insights from relevant sources,
- Translate tone into prompts,
- Create a vectorized wiki,
- Define content goals and pillars,
- Configure blog and channels,
- Finalize visuals and train models.

## Step Five — Boost Mode

We show you what your content will actually look like.

And yes, we preload your channels: typically 14–35 content units before launch.

### Iterations:

You give feedback. We tweak.

3 iterations are included (covers 99% of cases). If feedback is clear, you get exactly what you want. If not, clarify or pay extra.

If we go beyond 3 — you get up to 5 more, effectively free.

## What If You Need More?

Each extra iteration = +10%. But if you approve on round 4 → you pay 40% and we launch.

No black boxes. Just a system you want to keep.

📌 Next: launch. We’ll show you why our editorial loop outperforms any salaried team.
