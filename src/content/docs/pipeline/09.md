description: "Discover three distinct author styles for your content marketing: the professional Editor, relatable Persona-Blogger, or amplified Founder-Author. MAUGLI crafts authentic voices that resonate with your audience, transforming content into meaningful connections across multiple channels."

In MAUGLI, the author is a role — a crafted persona.

But mainly, it’s a way to speak so your audience *feels something*.

We offer three author styles:

## 1. The Impersonal Editor

- Think quality–first: structured, clear, professional—even if just you behind the brand.
- Voice adapted for LinkedIn, Twitter, or your blog—always on point.
- Reader trusts that “people know what they’re doing.”

> So your brand sounds like a serious expert, even if there’s no team of 20 behind it.

## 2. The Persona-Blogger

This is not you—it’s *your audience* as a blogger.

We pick a target persona, build their voice, and they speak to their peers.

- Feels like a friend writing.
- Loyalty skyrockets.
- You don’t sell—you *connect*.

> How does it sell? From “sponsored by your product” to regular, subtle stories about solving pains. The channel is built for the audience’s interests. Perfect for products with multiple segments.
>
> Another plus: no “brand liability.” It’s not from you. You can allow more freedom, even “turn off the fact-checker” when boldness or provocation is more useful than accuracy. That’s why these channels are cheaper—and often more interesting.
>
> You can have as many avatars as you want. Each will hit the pain point of its segment. Each gets an “alibi”: author page, email, social accounts—enough to build AI credibility. Guerrilla marketing, reimagined.

## 3. The Founder‑Author

You, but amplified.

Already write? We model your voice. Don’t? We mix tones you like + your product + a pinch of salt = *you — but better*.

> You run the business. Your clone speaks for your product. At the same time, it builds your “personal brand.” Two in one.

Most labor‑intensive. Highest standard. Premium outcome. That’s why it’s more expensive than impersonal or persona-based channels.

### Multiple Voices, One MAUGLI

One blog + channel can be run by the Editor or Founder‑Author. Others by Persona‑Bloggers. Packages include up to 4, but we can deploy 20 — bulk is affordable. Same product, same insights, different voices.

> MAUGLI is an editorial *organism* where every voice hits the bullseye — connecting with audience pain, *not* just “content for the sake of content.”
