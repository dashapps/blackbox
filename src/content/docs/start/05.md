Even top-tier operators make mistakes. We’ve minimized them on our side (more on that later), but we can’t promise perfection. Every piece of content needs a legally responsible human.

So—who's the official creator of your content?

It’s up to you:

- You can own that role.
- You can assign someone from your team.
- Or, you can delegate it to us—for 20% of your plan.

### Can you go full autopilot and skip human approvals?

Not at first. Until the system is retrained (usually after three full content cycles—about three months), we recommend keeping approvals manual.

If no edits happen during that window, then sure—flip the switch. Up to you.

Because legally, someone still has to be behind every piece of content.

Even if that someone clicked “approve” half-asleep on a Sunday.

Before launch, we’ll need to know: who’s the “human editor”? That way, our bots know where to send drafts for review.

Once you choose, we’re ready to go live.
