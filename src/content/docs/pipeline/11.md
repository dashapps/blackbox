title: "Total Control: Manual Approval"
description: Take full control of your content with manual approval before publishing. Review AI-filtered posts, approve, request revisions, or make quick edits directly in Slack, ensuring your brand voice remains consistent across all channels.

The post is written, reviewed, polished… Ready to publish?

Not just yet.

Before your content hits any channel—it hits you.

But first:

## Final AI Filters Before Launch

Before manual approval, your content goes through:

- Multiple editorial layers refining structure, clarity, and flow
- A Tone of Voice alignment tool to match your brand’s unique voice
- A channel preview generator—so if it’s a blog, you’ll see Slack-optimized and social-ready versions too
- Only then—it’s sent to your Slack for approval

## Who Approves?

One person. Officially.

Even if the whole team’s in the loop, only one holds the Approve button.

That’s either:

- You
- Or a designated team member
- But we only send content to one Slack account (via DM or private channel)

Why? Because when five people give feedback at once, it’s no longer editing—it’s entropy.

## Approval Options

You receive the post (or a batch) with three options:

1. ✅ Approve
   - The content is published on schedule.
2. ✍️ Request Revisions
   - Comments go to the author.
   - A revised version returns for review.
3. 🧠 Make Quick Edits Yourself
   - Want to tweak a line or swap a word? Do it directly in Slack.
   - Every edit is logged. All changes, approvals, and feedback are versioned.
   - After ~3 months, we retrain the model to reflect your voice.

> We track your tone, edit patterns, and style preferences. With each cycle, your brand voice gets sharper.

## Want to Focus on Product, Not Posts?

You’re not wrong.

We can take over the whole flow.

It only takes:

- +20% on your monthly plan
- and your trust—something we don’t waste

> MAUGLI is built around your product. If you want control, we’re hands-off. But if you want hands-free, we’ve got you.
