**A Blog Is Not “Just Another Section on Your Site”**

A blog is the nucleus of your ecosystem. It works for you forever. It’s the platform for your expertise. It remains yours, even when your product becomes so legendary it sells itself and you no longer need to write about it. Or when you simply decide to pause your media campaign.

- **Why does the blog still dominate in 2025?**
  Because AI loves text. And it respects blogs. People ask AI for answers. Which means: blog content → GPT answers. And yes, TikTok? They don’t even let AI in via API.
- **Channels AI reads (GPT, Gemini, Perplexity):**

  - Reddit
  - Mastodon
  - Medium
  - Blogs (RSS, XML, Atom). They prefer fast, static, perfectly indexable content. That’s exactly what we build.

## **MAUGLI Blogs — Perfectly Optimized**

- 🔗 Lightning-fast: Lighthouse 100/100 across the board — performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO
- 🧩 Indexing: every detail engineered for SEO and GPT-SEO
- 🧬 Portability: you can always take your blog with you (HTML+RSS)
- 🎨 Branding: logo, colors, fonts, signature, product — all yours

## **Can it be customized for my brand?**

Absolutely:

- Your fonts, branding, colors — included
- Want full custom styling? We’ll do it for an extra fee

## **Can I write blog posts manually?**

For the first 3 content cycles — no. We need clean data. Your new blog will hit full power after this period.

We track behavior to:

- see what works
- train the model on your audience
- scale what’s best

After 3 months — on request, we can add a full admin panel. If you want to write yourself, you can.

##  **Other Channels:**

####  **Twitter / X**

Yes, we support it. Autoposting, hook format, founder’s voice.

#### **LinkedIn**

Yes, but only for company pages. That’s the official way. Any service offering autoposting to personal pages uses gray APIs. Full automation, like in MAUGLI, is risky there. We don’t promise what we can’t guarantee. But you can always repost what the bots publish on your company page.

####  **Mastodon**

Yes, we manage it, with reposts by default. GPT reads it, Perplexity too. That means you’re at the top of AI search results.

####  **Reddit**

Yes, if your niche allows. We can manage it officially or as a persona.

####  **Telegram**

Optional. If your audience uses it — we’ll run it. As a brand or character.

####  **WhatsApp / Slack**

Optional notification layers. For internal workflows or publication alerts. Not the main publishing channel.

## **✉️ E-mail (beta)**

- Every blog has a “subscribe” module.
- Newsletter: weekly digest

## **🌍 Multilingual**

You can:

- run content in one language
- or in 5 languages at once
- each channel can have its own geography and language

### Bottom line: MAUGLI content means at least 5 channels.

And yes, we know how to automate video content too. But our focus is “AI recommendations” — and that means text. It’s more efficient. While others fight for attention in social feeds, we go where your competitors aren’t — but your audience already is.
