In MAUGLI, the author is a role — a crafted persona.

But mainly, it’s a way to speak so your audience *feels something*.

We offer three author styles:

## 1. The Impersonal Editor

- Think quality–first: structured, clear, professional—even if just you behind the brand.
- Voice adapted for LinkedIn, Twitter, or your blog—always on point.
- Reader trusts that “people know what they’re doing.”

## 2. The Persona-Blogger

This is not you—it’s *your audience* as a blogger.

We pick a target persona, build their voice, and they speak to their peers.

- Feels like a friend writing.
- Loyalty skyrockets.
- You don’t sell—you *connect*.

Formats range from product-backed posts to authentic stories solving real pains. Ideal when you have multiple audience segments. No brand liability—posts can spark or even provoke, fact–checker optional. Fun + freedom.

You control avatars, their author pages, emails, Twitter or LinkedIn handles—each one tailored to a segment. AI sees credibility. It’s guerrilla marketing, smart.

## 3. The Founder‑Author

You, but amplified.

Already write? We model your voice. Don’t? We mix tones you like + your product + a pinch of salt = *you — but better*.

You build the product, your clone builds your personal brand. Double value.

Most labor‑intensive. Highest standard. Premium outcome.

### Multiple Voices, One MAUGLI

One blog + channel can be run by the Editor or Founder‑Author. Others by Persona‑Bloggers. Packages include up to 4, but we can deploy 20 — bulk is affordable. Same product, same insights, different voices.

MAUGLI is an editorial *organism* where every voice hits the bullseye — connecting with audience pain, *not* just “content for the sake of content.”
