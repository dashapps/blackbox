title: "Research That Breathes the Market"
description: Discover our dual research methodology that uncovers genuine audience insights and pain points through SEO and social listening, delivering content that resonates rather than just ranks.

One of the main reasons why Maugli isn’t just another content generator is research.

Content that truly works doesn’t start with a prompt. It starts with understanding:

- what your audience wants to hear;
- what they’re already talking about;
- and what they can’t Google, but are dying to understand.

This is where our dual research engine kicks in.

## **Two Research Cores — Depending on Strategy**

### **1. SEO Engine**

We activate this for products that:

- are already being searched for;
- have well-formed questions around them;
- require organic search through keywords.

Here, we build content around pain points you can type into Google or ask GPT.

This is classic SEO — but paired with living, breathing formats, not boring “10 reasons to use a CRM” articles.

What works here:

→ semantic analysis,
→ clustering,
→ answer generation powered by GPT and Claude vectors,
→ human curation of final formats (post, longread, reply, microformat).

### **2. Insight Engine**

When we don’t wait for people to form a question — we go where the conversation is already on fire. Reddit, forums, ProductHunt, HackerNews, depending on your audience and topic.

The key: we use sources where real people talk about real pain.

And this is where the magic happens.

## **How We Surface Insights and Pain Points**

Once set up, the process takes just a few minutes. But it’s multi-step:

- scan dozens of subreddits and channels;
- score them with internal models: real value, engagement potential, audience match;
- run them through AI lenses — to check logic, emotion, structure;
- select the juiciest insights, worthy of analysis or an emotional trigger.

How is this different from “just checking out the competition”?

- Speed — from system launch to dozens of ideas in minutes.
- Quality — the kind editorial teams keep a dedicated analyst for.
- Format — from memes and hot takes to evergreen longreads.

## **Do You Need Evergreen or Viral?**

We do both:

- Evergreen — goes to your blog, landing pages, index.
- Insight drops — go to socials, reposts, discussions, emotional hooks.

Want more replies? We focus on hot takes.
Want Google index and clear structure? We focus on articles.

Yes, you can have both. Depending on your strategy and goals.

## **And This Is Just the First Filter**

Editorial is the next stage.

Every insight gets squeezed, edited, wrapped in the right format, and tested.

But that’s for later.

Right now, the key is:

You won’t be searching for ideas.

You won’t even be approving or filtering them until they’re already a content unit. We’ll serve you the best the internet has to offer — already tailored to your audience’s favorite recipe. On a platter, with a side of meaning.
