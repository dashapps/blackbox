title: Stack
description: MAUGLI's robust tech stack combines n8n, Supabase, GitHub, Astro, Netlify, Airtable, Zep, Qdrant, and Noosphere to create an editorial-neural system that launches in hours, adapts to any format, and delivers enterprise-grade performance without technical debt.

## **MAUGLI is Built from Solutions, Not Just Code**

MAUGLI isn’t lines of code—it’s a collection of breakthroughs.

- **We didn’t start from scratch.** In 2025, speed is everything.
- We assembled a **robust, resilient, and scalable stack** that:
  - launches in hours, not weeks;
  - adapts to any vertical or format;
  - is easily customized for any product vision;
  - does in days what others spend months building by hand.

## **Architecture, Not Improvisation**

This isn’t a patchwork of no-code hacks.

We **engineered the architecture** as a true system:

- every module is a microservice, laser-focused on its function;
- everything connects into a living organism through events and states;
- any part can be swapped, extended, or turned off—without breaking the whole.

We’re not chasing “millions of users.”

MAUGLI is designed as an **editorial-neural system** where precision, reliability, and flexibility matter more than raw session counts.

## **Low-Code—Not Because We Can’t Code**

But because **we’re too good to waste a year.**

- **n8n** — our backend engineer. Outpaces most junior devs.
- **Supabase** — not no-code, but Postgres with API, Auth, and Storage. One click, enterprise-grade.
- **GitHub + Astro + Netlify** — a hyper-lightweight, SEO-optimized blog for both humans and GPTs.
- **Airtable** — our interactive admin panel, with logic and full visual transparency.
- **Zep + Qdrant** — short- and long-term memory. GPT remembers not just “context,” but the entire editorial history.
- **Noosphere** — our Autogen, but faster, leaner, and with post-level memory built in.
