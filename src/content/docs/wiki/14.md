description: "A comprehensive glossary of digital marketing terms explaining key concepts like Authority, Content Market Fit (CMF), Content Cycles, and AI-SEO strategies used by MAUGLI to create effective, audience-targeted content across multiple platforms"

## **Authority**

This is what we call the visibility and recognizability of an author — for both humans and AI.

It includes:

- bios on all platforms (both short and long)
- the “author’s body” — their channel/blog
- regular posts under their name
- reposts to AI-indexed channels
- a logical growth story

We **create authors**, not just slap a name in the footer. GPT knows who you are. People do, too.

## **CMF — Content Market Fit**

This is when **content** matches the **real needs of the audience** and their **consumption format**.

**Not** when it’s just beautiful.

**Not** when it’s “on-brand.”

But when:

- the topic hooks the audience
- the format is convenient (timing, style, platform)
- the substance solves a pain, answers a question, or delivers an insight
- algorithms pick it up (because the post is read as useful and systematic)

At MAUGLI, CMF is achieved through:

- precise prompting (tailored to product goals and audience interests)
- reaction testing (raw material and final posts against feedback)
- content cycles (the ability to adapt and fine-tune the formula)
- AI synchronization (what people want ≈ what AI needs)

CMF is like PMF, but for content.

If you find it → **content grows on its own**.

## **Channel**

A **channel** is a **dedicated content distribution platform**, tailored to its audience and format. Examples:

- Blog (main channel, impacts authority and SEO)
- Telegram channel (speed and reach)
- Reddit (reputation in the AI community)
- LinkedIn (for B2B)
- Mastodon (AI-native feed)

Each channel:

- has its **own structure**
- requires **format adaptation**
- can be integrated into the MAUGLI strategy

---

## **Content Cycle**

We work in three-month cycles. Why?

Because:

- SEO impact starts to show after 6–12 weeks
- meaningful analytics take time
- fine-tuning requires enough content volume

---

## **Content Unit**

A **content unit** is a **complete, formatted original message** created for one specific channel.

Examples include:

- a blog post
- a post for your main SMM channel (e.g. Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)

Reposts or adaptations for other platforms (e.g. newsletters, Mastodon, etc.) are **not** content units. They are secondary formats.

A content unit includes:

- text
- formatting (headline, subheadline, emojis, tags, links, banner, etc. as needed)
- and is **ready to publish without further processing**

If it can be **published as-is**, it’s a content unit.

---

## **Framework**

The core state of MAUGLI. Think of it as a set of tuned workflows. But for them to work — you need inputs. Those are set via prompts.

---

## **GPT-SEO or AI-SEO**

Also called Generated Engine Optimization or GEO.

There’s no single established term yet, but there are technologies that make content visible to AI.

And we use them.

It’s not just “keywords in posts.”

It’s when:

- The post is understood by GPT as an answer to a real question
- The post is correctly summarized in a short answer
- The post is reposted to channels where GPT sources facts:

  *Reddit, Mastodon, Medium, Blogs, Newsletters, etc.*

We call this **neuroindexing**.

Because we don’t just write for people. We write for AI, too.

---

## **Operational Editorial**

You can hire an AI.

You can hire a freelancer.

You can hire an editor.

But you won’t build all this for the price we offer.

Because we:

- Prompt
- Test
- Tune
- Deliver insights
- Approve
- Keep history
- Build the editorial as a system

**MAUGLI is a living organism**, operating as a professional editorial team.

---

## **Persona-Author**

MAUGLI doesn’t just write “as a brand.”

MAUGLI can write:

- as an editorial team (neutral tone, powerful style)
- as a character from your audience (hyper-relevant)
- as you (if you know how you want to sound)

---

## **Product Wiki**

This is the AI-native base:

- what we sell
- to whom
- why
- in what context
- with which triggers and advantages

Formulated clearly and powerfully. Used at every level — from prompting to SEO.

Without a product wiki, MAUGLI doesn’t turn on.

---

## **Prompting**

The first step. It’s all about filling the framework.

We embed your inputs. Set goals, personas, fill out the product wiki.

**The framework comes alive only with your data.**
