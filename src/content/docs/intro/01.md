## Want to solve real business problems with content—not just tick the “social media” box or buy another content generator?

You know that:

- A $500 freelancer won’t deliver strategy or consistency;
- An agency means endless briefs, wasted time, and missed results;
- An in-house editorial team:
  - is expensive,
  - is slow,
  - and you don’t have the resources for it.

> That’s why MAUGLI is what you actually need.

### MAUGLI is a team that costs as much as a single top-tier hire, but operates like the editorial engine behind HubSpot:

- Each AI in the team has a dedicated role: researcher, copywriter, editor-in-chief, fact-checker…
- Every member is fully immersed in your product and goals.
- No one loses the thread. No one delivers “just another post.”

Our editorial team creates for your audience, in their language, with messaging that drives outcomes:

- Brand awareness,
- Engagement,
- Authority,
- Loyalty,
- And yes, even sales.

### So, what is MAUGLI?

1. An editorial team-in-a-box, with a pipeline built like leading media companies;
2. Channels + blog with SEO and AI-SEO: optimized for both Google and neural search engines;
3. Content people actually read and save: because it resonates.

Not SaaS. Not freelance. Not magic.

It’s an editorial brain, embedded in your business.
