title: "The Editorial Secret Sauce — The Pain Translator"
description: The Pain Translator transforms raw content ideas by testing them on emulated personas who provide authentic feedback, ensuring only high-impact material reaches your audience with precise contextual relevance.

Here’s where Maugli becomes something no living editorial team can match. Raw material goes through a test on the Target Audience — that is, on an emulated Persona.

This isn’t just your first line of feedback. It’s your personal pain translator, tuned directly to your audience’s context.

## **We’re Not Testing a Post — We’re Testing the Core Idea**

Crucially: it’s not a post, but the raw idea, surfaced through scoring, that gets put to work. The Persona evaluates the unformatted, unpolished concept. This gives you a real, unsweetened reaction.

### **What’s a Persona?**

Not a focus group. Not a “typical user.” It’s an emulation of your potential customer or user:

- with a life, opinions, context, and pain points;
- knows nothing about your product;
- doesn’t care about pleasing you;
- doesn’t play along to be “helpful”;
- their only job is to play their role, no matter what you ask. That’s why we call it emulation.

Personas outperform real people: they don’t lie, and their feedback is sharper.

### How Does the Persona Evaluate Material?

The Persona rates the raw idea on a live interest scale:

from “1 — I don’t care at all” to “5 — I’d save, share, or buy this.”

### If the Persona Scores Below 4 — The Post Goes to the Archive

No “maybe someone will like it.”

If even one representation says “nope,” the insight isn’t strong enough.

### **Pinpointing the Pain**

The real magic happens when the Persona localizes pain:

They might say:

- “I don’t care how it works in WeChat — I want to know how startups are hacking this through Discord or Slack.”
- Or: “You’re referencing Alipay features — but in the US market, I need to know what Stripe or Square is doing.”

### **Why Does the Persona Outperform Real People?**

> The Persona delivers a conscious translation of context and pain into the right environment.

No focus group can do this. They just say “I don’t like it.” The Persona tells you why, and how to make it work.

> In early 2023 tests, 95% of reactions from virtual personas built on real users matched prototype reactions. Now it’s even more accurate — better than real user surveys.

Yes, well-crafted avatars outperform real users.

They explain why something didn’t land, and show what would.

They see context and act not as a filter, but as the perfect mediator between meaning and channel.

### What Happens After the Persona Gives Feedback?

If the Persona scores the raw idea 4 or higher, it’s refined with their input:

- format (“this works as a hot take, not a full article”),
- tone (“please, don’t make this another tired motivational piece”),
- analogies (“it’s like Notion, but for founder syncs”),
- and only then does it go into full editorial production.

### Thanks to Personas, the Editorial Team Creates Content That Triggers the Audience and Drives Predictable Reactions

In a traditional newsroom without a Bloomberg budget, posts are a shot in the dark. Even if you try to plug real users into your editorial pipeline, you’ll never get this level of precision or speed on raw material.

This isn’t A/B testing. It’s a live insight boost before you even start writing.
