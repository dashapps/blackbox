Neural networks aren’t magic. Let’s be real: sometimes a creator goes too far—overdoes the voice, the style, the ego. But even top-tier copywriters rarely nail a post on draft one. Feedback isn’t optional.

In a traditional team, the draft goes to an editor. In MAUGLI, we route it to another “target persona.” That voice gives raw, honest reactions: “Cool idea, but too personal,” “Too much fluff,” “Over the top,” or “This? This hit me hard.” That happens too.

Usually, there’s at least one round of edits. Sometimes two or three.

**How do we know it’s ready to go?** The persona decides.

And no — not every post should be perfect. Sometimes it needs *open loops* — questions that spark comments.

**Who replies?** We’re not offering that in flat-rate packages yet. If your channel has 50 followers, sure — covered. If you’ve got 500K engaged users? That’s a whole different game. Comments are chains. They have to feel *human*. And that costs tokens. AI doesn’t think for free.

So yes — full comment management is possible. But it’s usage-based. Ask us.

**BTW**: persona questions *always* get answered — even if your channel is manual. We prepare answers *before* the post goes live.

Before anyone asks. That’s how deep the framework goes.
