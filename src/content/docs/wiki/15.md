Noosphere is our proprietary internal communication system for MAUGLI agents.

It‚Äôs not built on LangChain, Autogen, or CrewAI.
This is our own innovation: a collaborative environment with persistent memory and defined roles ‚Äî not just a chain of calls.

In Noosphere:

- Every agent knows its role and state
- Communication happens directly via @mentions or through process-driven tasks
- Agents share context seamlessly without losing state
- The entire conversation history is preserved and accessible

üß† Noosphere ‚â† LangChain:
No linear pipelines. This is a living organism ‚Äî parts interact in real time.

‚öôÔ∏è Noosphere ‚â† Autogen:
No one-shot calls or single prompts. We use personas with persistent memory.

üß≠ Noosphere ‚â† CrewAI:
No central captain. Editorial control is collective.
